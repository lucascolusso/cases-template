Resultados Digitais’ design challenge
Proccess description

At first, I took half an hour to thoroughly read the challenge and understand it. Next thing was thinking about the proposed information hierarchy, identifying inconsistencies which were therefore addressed in the wireframe design1. The whole initial understanding about the project happened in almost one hour. Then, as some changes in the structure of sessions and content were going to be made, I re-wrote2 the challenge doc to organize it the way I thought it was going to be more helpful when I started the actual design. This took another half hour. At last I searched for all the images that the project required, in the clients website and in search engines. After one hour, the preparation phase was over.

With the wireframe, the images and the organized content in hands, coding started. For this project I decided to test an app called Webflow3, that promises to streamline front-end development. This web app allows designers to make production-ready prototypes through an WYSIWYG interface. It uses Bootstrap grid and naming structures, while exporting readable code. I guessed this was the best tool to use as the time available for the challenge was meager. The tool also enables responsive design to be made, but this was intentionally overlooked in order to attend the proposed deadline. The design of the prototype took about 5 hours. Overall, the experiment with Webflow was rewarding.

With the exported code in hands, I uploaded it to a Github repo4 and had to learn how to deploy it through Heroku, which was fairly simple5. Nevertheless, this last stage was time-consuming (XXxxxxXXXX hours), since I’ve never done this kind of thing before. Finally, I tested the URLs in other computers to see if everything was correct.
